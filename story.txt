There once was a man named George who lived in New York. He worked at a pub and loved making friends with the regulars. 

George slides over to get Tom another drink. So how was your weekend? asked George. Tom looked straight into his eyes and sayed, I did something really bad George, and I need your help to fix it.

Leaning in closer to George, Tom admits that he's stolen a vehicle. Although stunned and disappointed, George agrees to help his friend. As they leave the bar, police sirens grow closer. 

It's been five years since George was attempted to be arrested. After hypnotizing the police officers who were taking him to jail, he escaped, and no one has seen him since. Rumor has it, he fled the country, but many people claim their local bartenders look an awful lot like him.
