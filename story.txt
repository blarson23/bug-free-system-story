There once was a man named George who lived in New York. He worked at a pub and loved making friends with the regulars. 

George slides over to get Tom another drink. So how was your weekend? asked George. Tom looked straight into his eyes and sayed, I did something really bad George, and I need your help to fix it.

Leaning in closer to George, Tom admits that he's stolen a vehicle. Although stunned and disappointed, George agrees to help his friend. As they leave the bar, police sirens grow closer. 

The cops come rushing into the pub, but to everyone's dismay, it is not Tom who is arrested, but George. When Tom asked the police why he was arrested, Tom found out that the reason he stole a vehicle was because George 
hypnotized him and forced him to steal the car for him. Now it is clear why George enjoyed making friends with the regulars.  

It has now been five years since George was attempted to be arrested. After hypnotizing the officers who were bringing him to fail, George escaped, and he hasn't been seen since. Rumor has it, he fled the country, but many people report that their friendly local bartender looks an awful lot like him.
