There once was a man named George who lived in New York. He worked at a pub and loved making friends with the regulars. 

George slides over to get Tom another drink. So how was your weekend? asked George. Tom looked straight into his eyes and sayed, I did something really bad George, and I need your help to fix it.

Leaning in closer to George, Tom admits that he's stolen a vehicle. Although stunned and disappointed, George agrees to help his friend. As they leave the bar, police sirens grow closer.
